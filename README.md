This is a project I'm using to practice CSS and HTML.
The goal is to create a copy of the Google homepage, at least in appearance, using HTML and CSS.
Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with HTML, CSS and Git.
By the completion of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a webpage, based on pre-existing content, using CSS and HTML and will also have demonstrated my ability to use Git and GitHub for version control.

The original idea for this project comes from The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
